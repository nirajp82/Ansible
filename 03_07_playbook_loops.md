**Ansible loops** allow you to repeat a task multiple times, with each iteration using different values. This can be useful for automating repetitive tasks, such as creating multiple user accounts or installing multiple software packages.

Here is a simple example of an Ansible loop:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Install Apache and MySQL
    yum:
      name:
      - httpd
      - mysql
      state: present
```

This task will install the Apache and MySQL packages on all of the remote hosts. The `yum` module is able to install multiple packages at once, so this loop is not necessary in this case. However, loops are often useful for tasks that cannot be performed with a single module invocation.

Here is a more complex example of an Ansible loop:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  vars:
    users:
    - user1
    - user2
    - user3

  tasks:
  - name: Create user accounts
    user:
      name: "{{ item }}"
      state: present
    loop: "{{ users }}"
```

This task will create the `user1`, `user2`, and `user3` user accounts on all of the remote hosts. The `loop` keyword tells Ansible to iterate over the `users` variable and execute the task for each item in the variable.

Ansible loops can also be used with conditional statements. For example, the following task will only install the Apache package if the `is_apache_installed` variable is set to `False`:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  vars:
    is_apache_installed: "{{ lookup('package', 'httpd').installed }}"

  tasks:
  - name: Install Apache
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
    when: not is_apache_installed
```

Ansible loops are a powerful tool that can be used to automate a wide variety of tasks. By using loops, you can save time and reduce the risk of errors.

* lookup() filter: The lookup() filter is a special type of filter that allows you to retrieve data from external sources. In this case, the lookup() filter is being used to retrieve the installation status of the Apache package.

  The lookup() filter takes two arguments: the name of the external source and the query to be executed against the external source. In this case, the external source is the package module, which provides information about installed packages. The query is simply the name of the Apache package.

  The lookup() filter will return the output of the query, which in this case is a boolean value indicating whether or not the Apache package is installed.

  The is_apache_installed variable is then set to the value returned by the lookup() filter. This variable can then be used in Ansible conditional statements and loops to control the execution of tasks.
