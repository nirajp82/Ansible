In Ansible, tasks are the individual units of work that are executed on target hosts. Each task performs a specific action, such as installing a package, copying files, or restarting a service. Tasks are defined within Ansible playbooks, which are YAML files specifying a set of tasks to be executed on remote hosts.

The `include_tasks` module in Ansible allows you to include tasks from an external file within your playbook. This is useful for organizing your playbook into smaller, manageable files and for reusing common sets of tasks across multiple playbooks.

Here's the basic syntax of the `include_tasks` module:

```yaml
- name: Include tasks from an external file
  include_tasks: path/to/external_tasks.yml
```

In this example, Ansible will include tasks from the `external_tasks.yml` file and execute them within the playbook.

Let's consider a more detailed example to illustrate the usage of `include_tasks`. Suppose you have a playbook that needs to configure a web server. Instead of defining all tasks within the main playbook, you can organize them into separate files for better readability and maintenance.

**File: `webserver_tasks.yml`**

```yaml
# webserver_tasks.yml

- name: Install Apache web server
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present

- name: Copy Apache configuration file
  copy:
    src: /path/to/apache.conf
    dest: /etc/apache2/apache.conf
  notify: Restart Apache

- name: Start Apache service
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
```

In your main playbook, you can use the `include_tasks` module to include these tasks:

**File: `main_playbook.yml`**

```yaml
# main_playbook.yml

- name: Configure Web Server
  hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Include web server configuration tasks
      include_tasks: webserver_tasks.yml
```

In this example, the `webserver_tasks.yml` file contains tasks related to configuring the Apache web server. The `include_tasks` module is used in the `main_playbook.yml` to include these tasks. When you run the `main_playbook.yml`, Ansible will execute the tasks specified in `webserver_tasks.yml` as part of the playbook execution.

Using `include_tasks` helps maintain a modular and organized structure in your Ansible playbooks, allowing you to reuse task sets across different playbooks and manage complex configurations more effectively.
