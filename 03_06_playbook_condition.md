Conditional statements in Ansible allow you to execute tasks based on certain conditions. For example, you can use a conditional statement to install a different package on Debian systems than on RHEL systems. Or, you can use a conditional statement to skip a task if a certain file is already present on the remote system.

To use a conditional statement in Ansible, you use the `when` keyword. The `when` keyword takes a boolean expression as its argument. The task will only be executed if the boolean expression evaluates to `true`.

Here is an example of a conditional statement in Ansible:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Install Apache
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
    when: ansible_distribution == 'CentOS'
```

This task will only be executed if the remote system is running CentOS. If the remote system is running a different distribution, the task will be skipped.

You can also use the `and` and `or` operators in conditional statements. The `and` operator means that both conditions must be met in order for the task to be executed. The `or` operator means that either condition can be met in order for the task to be executed.

Here is an example of a conditional statement that uses the `and` operator:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Install Apache and MySQL
    yum:
      name:
      - httpd
      - mysql
      state: present
    when: ansible_distribution == 'CentOS' and ansible_memory_mb >= 4096
```

This task will only be executed if the remote system is running CentOS and has at least 4GB of memory.

Here is an example of a conditional statement that uses the `or` operator:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Install Apache or Nginx
    yum:
      name:
      - httpd
      - nginx
      state: present
    when: ansible_distribution == 'CentOS' or ansible_distribution == 'Debian'
```

This task will be executed if the remote system is running either CentOS or Debian.
