To verify a playbook in Ansible, you can use the following methods:

* **Check mode:** Check mode allows you to run a playbook without making any changes to the remote systems. This is a good way to test your playbook before running it in production. To run a playbook in check mode, use the `--check` option:

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check
```

If the playbook is syntactically correct and all of the modules are supported, Ansible will display a report of the changes that would be made if the playbook were run in normal mode.

* **Diff mode:** Diff mode allows you to see the before-and-after state of the remote systems after running a playbook. This is a good way to verify that the playbook is making the expected changes. To run a playbook in diff mode, use the `--diff` option:

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --diff
```

If the playbook is syntactically correct and all of the modules are supported, Ansible will display a diff of the changes that would be made if the playbook were run in normal mode.

* **Syntax check:** You can also use the `--syntax-check` option to check the syntax of a playbook:

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --syntax-check
```

This will check the playbook for any syntax errors and report them to you.

Once you have verified your playbook, you can run it in normal mode using the following command:

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

This will run the playbook and make the changes that you specified.

Here is an example of a complete Ansible playbook:

```
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Install Apache
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
```

To verify this playbook, you could run the following commands:

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --diff
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --syntax-check
```

If the playbook is syntactically correct and all of the modules are supported, all of these commands should succeed. Once you are confident that the playbook is correct, you can run it in normal mode using the following command:

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

This will install the Apache web server on all of the remote systems in your inventory.

It is important to note that not all Ansible modules support check mode or diff mode. If you are using a module that does not support check mode or diff mode, you will not be able to use those features to verify your playbook.
