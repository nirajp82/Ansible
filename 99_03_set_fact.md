In Ansible, the `set_fact` module is used to set variables dynamically within a playbook. You can use this module to create new variables or modify existing ones during the execution of the playbook. This can be useful when you need to calculate values based on certain conditions, retrieve information from tasks, or set variables dynamically based on the outcome of tasks.

Here's an example of how you can use `set_fact` and conditionals together in an Ansible playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Example Playbook with set_fact and conditionals
  hosts: your_target_hosts
  tasks:
    - name: Check if a file exists
      stat:
        path: /path/to/your/file.txt
      register: file_status

    - name: Set a variable based on file existence
      set_fact:
        file_exists: true
      when: file_status.stat.exists

    - name: Display a message based on the variable value
      debug:
        msg: "The file exists!"
      when: file_exists

    - name: Display a different message if the file doesn't exist
      debug:
        msg: "The file doesn't exist!"
      when: not file_exists
```

In this example:

1. The `stat` module checks if a file (`/path/to/your/file.txt` in this case) exists on the remote hosts and stores the result in the `file_status` variable using the `register` keyword.

2. The `set_fact` module creates a new variable called `file_exists` and sets its value to `true` when the file exists (as determined by the `when` condition based on the `file_status` variable).

3. The `debug` module then uses a conditional (`when: file_exists`) to print a message only if the `file_exists` variable is `true`. If the file doesn't exist, the second `debug` task will be executed due to the conditional (`when: not file_exists`).

Using `set_fact` with conditionals allows you to dynamically set variables based on the outcome of tasks and make decisions in your playbook logic.
