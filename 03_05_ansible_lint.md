Ansible Lint is a tool that checks Ansible playbooks for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved. It can be used to find errors, warnings, and even suggestions for improvement.

To use Ansible Lint, simply run the following command:

```
ansible-lint playbook.yml
```

This will check the specified playbook for any issues and report them to you.

Ansible Lint reports errors, warnings, and suggestions for improvement in the following categories:

* **Syntax:** Ansible Lint will check for any syntax errors in your playbook.
* **Best practices:** Ansible Lint will check for any best practices violations in your playbook, such as using the correct module names, avoiding hard-coded values, and using variables consistently.
* **Security:** Ansible Lint will check for any security vulnerabilities in your playbook, such as using the correct permissions for files and directories, and avoiding the use of unsafe modules.


Here is an example:

- playbook.yml
```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Install Apache
    shell: yum -y install httpd
```

```
ansible-lint playbook.yml
```

**Ansible Lint report:**

```
INFO: File: playbook.yml
WARNING: Use FQCN for builtin module actions (shell)
SUGGESTION: Use the 'yum' module instead of the 'shell' module for installing packages
```

**After the fix:**

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Install Apache
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
```

The fix replaces the `shell` module with the `yum` module to install the Apache package. This is a better practice, because the `yum` module is designed specifically for installing packages on RHEL systems. 
The state: present option in Ansible modules will ensure that the package is installed and its latest version.

For example, if the Apache web server package is already installed, but there is a newer version available in the repository, the yum module will upgrade the package to the newer version.

**Another example:**

**Before the fix:**

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Create a new user account
    user:
      name: myuser
      state: present
      groups: sudo
```

**Ansible Lint report:**

```
INFO: File: playbook.yml
WARNING: No inventory specified for task 'Create a new user account'
```

**After the fix:**

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Create a new user account
    user:
      name: myuser
      state: present
      groups: sudo
      become: yes
```

The fix adds the `become: yes` option to the task. This is necessary because the `user` module requires elevated privileges to create new user accounts.

Here is an example of how to use Ansible Lint to check a playbook:

```
ansible-lint playbook.yml
```

This will check the playbook named `playbook.yml` for any issues and report them to you.

You can also use Ansible Lint to check multiple playbooks at once. To do this, simply specify the playbooks that you want to check on the command line:

```
ansible-lint playbook1.yml playbook2.yml playbook3.yml
```

This will check the three playbooks named `playbook1.yml`, `playbook2.yml`, and `playbook3.yml` for any issues and report them to you.

Ansible Lint is a powerful tool that can help you to improve the quality of your Ansible playbooks. By taking the time to check your playbooks with Ansible Lint, you can help to ensure that your playbooks are reliable and secure.
