The provided Ansible code is an example of conditional rendering based on the existence of a file. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

- **`- name: Conditional Rendering Example`**: This line defines the name of the Ansible playbook. It provides a description of what the playbook is intended to do.

- **`hosts: localhost`**: Specifies that the tasks in this playbook will be executed on the local machine where Ansible is run (`localhost` refers to the local host).

- **`vars:`**: This section allows you to define variables that can be used within the playbook.

  - **`file_path: "/path/to/your/file"`**: Defines a variable named `file_path` with the value `"/path/to/your/file"`. You should replace this with the actual path to the file you want to check for existence.

- **`tasks:`**: This section defines the list of tasks that Ansible will execute.

  - **`- name: Check if file exists`**: Describes the first task. The `name` parameter provides a description for the task.

    - **`stat:`**: This is a Ansible module that provides access to file attributes on remote systems. In this case, it checks if the file specified in the `path` parameter (which is `{{ file_path }}` in this playbook) exists or not. The `stat` module collects various attributes of the file, such as size, modification time, and whether it's a directory or a regular file.

      - **`path: "{{ file_path }}"`**: This is a parameter of the `stat` module. `{{ file_path }}` is a Jinja2 template variable that gets replaced with the value of the `file_path` variable defined in the `vars` section of the playbook. It specifies the path to the file that the `stat` module will check for existence.

      - **`register: file_info`**: This line of code registers the output of the `stat` module to a variable named `file_info`. When a task is executed, Ansible collects information from the task and stores it in the variable specified after `register:`. In this case, the `stat` module checks whether the file specified by the `file_path` variable exists, and the resulting information is stored in the `file_info` variable.

  - **`- name: Render HTML based on file existence`**: Describes the second task.

    - **`template:`**: This module is used for template-based copying or rendering. It takes a source file (template) and renders it with specific variables to generate the destination file.

      - **`src: template.j2`**: Specifies the source template file. The file named `template.j2` contains the template that will be rendered.

      - **`dest: /path/to/output/file.html`**: Specifies the destination file where the rendered template will be saved. You should replace `/path/to/output/file.html` with the desired path for the output file.

    - **`vars:`**: Allows you to define variables that will be available within the template.

      - **`condition: "{{ file_info.stat.exists }}"`** :After registering the output of the `stat` module in the `file_info` variable, the `Render HTML based on file existence` task uses this variable. The `file_info.stat.exists` expression evaluates to `true` if the file specified in `file_path` exists and `false` otherwise. This condition is then used in your template (`template.j2`) or other parts of your playbook logic to determine the behavior based on the existence of the file. For example, in your template, you can use this `condition` variable to conditionally render HTML content based on whether the file exists or not..

In summary, this Ansible playbook checks if a specified file exists using the `stat` module. Depending on the existence of the file, it renders an HTML template (`template.j2`) to a destination file (`/path/to/output/file.html`). The rendered template's behavior is controlled by the `condition` variable, which is set based on the existence of the specified file.
